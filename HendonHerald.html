                        <h3>Spirit Eyes Cannon</h3>
                        <p>The Ghost of General Havelock appears to be considering using the cannon left in Mowbray
                            park- in protest at moving his bin collection to Tuesdays instead of Thursday.</p>
                        <p>The cannon, left pointing at the civic centre in case of another infestation of the Rage
                            virus seems to be the target of the Victorian Militaryman Shade's attentions.</p>
                        <p>When pressed, the wraith said "I'm buried at Lucknow, so getting here to put the bins out for
                            Tuesday is impossible, the connecting flights just aren't there."</p>
                        <p>Queen Victoria, Greyfriars Bobby and Sunderland City council were unavailable for comment.

                        <h3>Blandford Street Found "Wonky"</h3>
                        <p>Keen shoppers were undeterred as Blandford Street at the heart of the city was seen to be a
                            bit skewiff. From Herbet Brown's to Debenhams, the whole street appeared tilted off to the
                            right somehow.</p>
                        <p>We contacted a spokesperson for H&amp;T Pawnbrokers said "To be honest, we haven't noticed
                            anything unusual outside. There has been no drop off in trade, punters are here putting
                            their wedding rings on tick just as desperately as usual."</p>
                        <p>Our roving photographer, Nathanial Ventricle, took this shocking image moments after picking
                            up his new tripod from Chas Eagle's and Sons. Nathanial said "You know what's odd, the
                            people on Blandford Street look wonky too- normally they'd be upri...oh.. wait..."</p>

                        <h3>Amy's Winehouse Urged into Rehab</h3>
                        <p>Amy's Winehouse has said "no no no" to calls to enter rehab after complaints of rowdy
                            behaviour about the songstressly-named offy.</p>
                        <p>A neighbour, who wishes to remain anonymous, has seen Amy's Winehouse selling the following
                            in broad daylight:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fine Wines &amp; Champagnes</li>
                            <li>Rough Ciders &amp; Spirits</li>
                            <li>Terry's Chocolate Orange, which no one ever seems to buy</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Amy's Winehouse ain't got the time to make a comment, adding the retail outlet's daddy thinks
                            she's fine.</p>

                    <h3>About Our Editor</h3>
                    <p>Our chief editor, Ahab McRadgie has had a long career in the media, despite his youth. Starting
                        off taxing dafties for 20p, who he assured he needed the money to get home to his dying
                        grandmother. He soon set to work selling the Big Issue, then graduated on to harder, more potent
                        local newspapers.<br> Ahab has been given a Regional Press Award for his scoop "Ryhope man
                        catches train" and a restraining order after the incident with the inflatable crocodile, the
                        vodka and small arms we don't talk about, but <i>no one</i> will ever forget. Even though we
                        tried hard. <i>So, so hard</i>.</p>
